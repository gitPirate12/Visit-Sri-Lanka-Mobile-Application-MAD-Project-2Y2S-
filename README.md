## Running the Project in Android Studio

### 1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

### 2. **Open the Project in Android Studio**:
   - Launch **Android Studio**.
   - Open the project folder by navigating to **File > Open** and selecting the project directory (`Visit-Sri-Lanka-Mobile-Application`).

### 3. **Install Dependencies**:
   You will need to install the project dependencies using npm:
   1. Open the **Terminal** in Android Studio (bottom tab or use `Alt + F12`).
   2. Run the following command in the project root:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

### 4. **Configure Android SDK**:
   Ensure the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured:
   - In Android Studio, go to **File > Project Structure > SDK Location**.
   - Check that the Android SDK path is set correctly.

### 5. **Start the Metro Bundler**:
   Before running the app, start the React Native Metro bundler:
   ```bash
   npx react-native start
   ```

### 6. **Run the App on an Emulator/Device**:
   Once the bundler is running, you can launch the app:
   - Ensure an Android Emulator is running, or connect a physical Android device via USB with **Developer Mode** and **USB Debugging** enabled.
   - Run the following command to launch the app:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

   Alternatively, you can click the **Run** button in Android Studio to compile and run the app directly from the IDE.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting:

1. **Metro Bundler Issues**:
   - If the bundler is stuck or not loading, restart it using:
     ```bash
     npx react-native start --reset-cache
     ```

2. **Emulator Problems**:
   - If the emulator is not starting, make sure youâ€™ve configured the Android Virtual Device (AVD) in Android Studio by going to **Tools > AVD Manager**.

3. **USB Debugging Issues**:
   - If a physical device is not detected, ensure **Developer Mode** and **USB Debugging** are enabled on your Android device.
